# GII-DataVisualization
Gender inequality is not just a social issue—it's a developmental challenge that affects health, 
education, economics, and governance. While the GII provides a quantitative lens, our 
mission is to transform this data into a visual, interactive, and comprehensible story that 
highlights both progress and persisting disparities. 
For this we have used TOP-DOWN approach wherein we begin at the Macro level and then 
dive into the Micro aspects of the problem and answer the arising questions. 
Our Top-Down Approach consists of 4 Major Parts: 
1. Global Gender Inequality Landscape 
Top-level: Macro view of the entire world 
2. Gender Inequality Progress & Time Series Drill-Down 
Time-focused: Explore how GII has evolved 
3. GII Dimensions Breakdown 
Component-focused: Analyse the internal drivers of inequality 
4. Country-Level Deep Dive & Profiles 
Micro-level: Country-specific dashboards for granular exploration 
In short, our mission is to use data to inform, engage, and empower. Through rich visual 
storytelling, we transform decades of data into a clear roadmap of where gender inequality 
stands—and where it is headed.
